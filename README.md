# 🗳️ DAO Smart Contract

## 📌 Project Title
**Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Contract**

## 🧾 Project Description
This DAO smart contract allows for decentralized proposal creation and community-driven voting on-chain. It enables the contract owner to create proposals and lets participants vote to signal consensus. Once a proposal gains votes, it can be executed to reflect collective decision-making.

## 🎯 Project Vision
The goal of this project is to lay the foundational framework for a decentralized governance system that empowers communities to participate in organizational decisions without relying on centralized control or intermediaries. 

This smart contract can serve as the governance backbone for DAOs in DeFi, NFTs, community treasuries, or any Web3-native collective.

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🏗️ **Proposal Creation**: Only the DAO owner can create proposals.
- 🗳️ **Voting System**: Any participant can vote on proposals, one vote per address.
- 🔒 **Vote Tracking**: Prevents double voting by tracking who has voted.
- ✅ **Proposal Execution**: Owner can execute proposals after community approval (i.e., at least one vote).
- 🔍 **Proposal Metadata**: Each proposal has an ID, description, vote count, and execution status.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- ⚖️ **Token-Based Voting**: Introduce governance tokens for vote weighting.
- 🧠 **Quorum & Timelocks**: Require a minimum number of votes and introduce delay before execution.
- 🛡️ **Permissionless Proposal Creation**: Allow verified members or token holders to propose ideas.
- 📡 **Multisig Integration**: Combine with Gnosis Safe or similar for secure proposal execution.
- 🧩 **Modular Actions**: Add ability for proposals to execute on-chain logic (e.g., treasury transfers).
- 🌐 **Frontend Dashboard**: Build a UI for proposal tracking, voting, and execution via MetaMask.
