# 🏛️ DAO Governance Platform

---

## 📖 Project Description

DAO Governance Platform is a Solidity-based decentralized system that enables the creation of proposals, community voting, and transparent execution of governance decisions.

---

## 🌟 Project Vision

Our goal is to build a lightweight and transparent mechanism for decentralized communities to make decisions in a trustless environment using smart contracts.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Proposal Creation**: Admin can create governance proposals with deadlines.
- **Voting**: One vote per address per proposal. Votes are tracked on-chain.
- **Execution**: Proposals can be executed after the voting period ends.
- **View Proposal Details**: Public function to fetch proposal data.
- **Vote Tracking**: Anyone can check if a voter has already voted.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- **Token-weighted Voting**: Assign voting power based on governance token holdings.
- **Role-based Access**: Add delegate and reviewer roles for complex governance.
- **Gasless Voting**: Off-chain or zero-cost voting integration.
- **IPFS Integration**: Store full proposal metadata and documentation off-chain.
- **Frontend dApp**: UI to create, vote, and view proposals easily.
- **Quadratic Voting**: Implement advanced fairness mechanisms.
